## Summary

Home Schooler is an AI Tutor Dapp designed to assist high school students in their studies. It leverages the capabilities of Galadriel, a platform that empowers developers to create AI applications and agents via smart contracts. By utilizing Galadriel, Home Schooler operates in a decentralized manner, ensuring that all interactions and data are managed on-chain. This integration provides a secure, transparent, and efficient educational tool for students, utilizing the latest advancements in AI and blockchain technology.


## Overview

Home Schooler is an AI-powered educational companion designed to revolutionize the learning experience for high school students. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools to support personalized learning, making education accessible, engaging, and effective. One of its key features is the ability to create detailed tutorials by selecting the school system, class or year, and subject, then entering the tutorial title, description, and objectives, and adding content such as text, media, and interactive elements. Once a tutorial is created, students can select a topic they wish to learn about, and Home Schooler will generate a detailed tutorial. 

Additionally, Home Schooler can query the web and present relevant YouTube videos based on the current tutorial, enhancing the learning experience with supplementary visual and auditory resources. Another powerful feature is the ability to generate interactive quizzes and tests aligned with the tutorial content, providing immediate feedback and helping students reinforce their understanding and track their progress over time. This integration of personalized tutorials, multimedia content, and interactive assessments ensures that Home Schooler caters to diverse learning styles and promotes effective, active learning.

I was inspired to create Home Schooler to assist my son, who is currently in Form 1 in high school. Wanting to develop a tool that could provide personalized and engaging learning experiences, I designed Home Schooler to cater to his educational needs and to help other students.

## How it's built

 The front end is crafted using Next.js, a robust React framework renowned for its rapid and efficient rendering capabilities. Tailwind CSS is employed for styling, offering a utility-first design approach that guarantees a sleek and uniform interface. Furthermore, the platform harnesses the power of Remix to deploy smart contracts on Galadriel.  

 At the heart and soul of Home Schooler is Galadriel, the first Layer 1 platform designed specifically for AI. Home Schooler connects and leverages OpenAI to create tutorials, search the web for YouTube videos, and generate interactive quizzes and tests. This integration ensures that Home Schooler provides a powerful, personalized educational experience that meets the diverse needs of students.
